The top three databases for large data would be Cassandra, HBase, MongoDB. But
after careful reasearch I'm in between Cassandra and MongoDB. HBase has general 
better performancethan Cassandra and is less complex, but Cassandra is faster due to its 
consistent hashing for data partitioning and distribution. If support for a query language 
is required, Apache Cassandra should be preferred over MongoDB. If we need a flexible model
with efficient secondary indexes, MongoDB would be a better solution.


As for Backend Framework interface for React.js, I would say Django because it has better 
security than Node.js
